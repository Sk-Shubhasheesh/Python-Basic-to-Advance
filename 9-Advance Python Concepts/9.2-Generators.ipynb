    "# Generators\n",
    "* Generators in Python are a simple and powerful tool for creating iterators. They allow you to iterate over a set of values one at a time without having to store them all in memory simultaneously. Generators are created using functions and the yield keyword.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Concepts\n",
    "1. Generator Function: A function that uses the yield keyword to return values one at a time.\n",
    "2. Generator Object: An object created by calling a generator function. This object adheres to the iterator protocol, meaning it implements __iter__() and __next__() methods."
